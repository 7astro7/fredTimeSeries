# fredTimeSeries
Prepares St. Louis Fed. real estate, commodity, and total market data. The original intent was estimating a linear model. 
The focus pivots once evidence of a unit root is apparent after seasonal adjustment and time trend removal. My strategy of 
asking which observation contributes the most to kurtosis for each series is not original: it is Nassim Taleb's strategy 
seen in his Fat Tailed Statistics Project. 
There is no attempt at prognoisis in my project. The chief aim is examining the data with an eye toward antifragility.
